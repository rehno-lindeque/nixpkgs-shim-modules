# nixpkgs-shim-modules
[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

Nix modules as defined in NixOS, but exported so that they can be used independently.

## Contributing

I'm not too interested in maintaining this repo for the long term. If others do find this useful, I would suggest
we contribute back to mainline nixpkgs or otherwise I'd also welcome transferring ownership to [nix-community](https://github.com/nix-community).
